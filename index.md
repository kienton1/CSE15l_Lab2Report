**Explaining the Code**
First of all both of the screenshots that print out the wanted strings both use the main(String[] args) methods from the NumberServer class to first serve as an entry point for the application. This methods first checks if the port number is provided as a command- line argument, and then it parses it, and finally it starts to create a server on the port number and computer using the Server.start() method. Then after that, The handler class and the handleRequest(URI url) method is used to implement the HTTP requests. First it takes a URI object requesting the requested URL and then it returns the response based on what the path after the url is. It also takes in parameters and then implements them into the website. The screenshot that displays “jpolitz: Hello” uses the handleRequest(URI url) with the url being the root path in addition to the path after that that is then retrieved by the code using the getpath method. This get path method then gets everything after the port URL and then decides what to do with that. The first path that I input into the website would be /add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz. This is returned by the url.getPath() which then contains the “/add-message” from the else if statement which then leads to the code going down the else if statement. This then leads to the usage of the getQuery().split(“&”) methods to first get the query or everything after the ? from the url, and then it splits up the query into two elements based on where the & character is. This then goes down the for look taking in both elements from the getQuery().split(“&”) as a parameter, iterating though the for loop once for each element in the query, and then it uses the split() method again to split up the key from the user’s input. The code then stores the two elements in an array and then runs through an if and an if else statement to detect if the key is either “s” or equal to “user”. This is done using the equals key to compare the characters from two strings to each other making sure that they are the same. This then separates the parameters based on what their keys are and then the Arrays.copyOf(pageTExt, pageText.legnth + 1) is used to copy the initial array of messages with one extra array length to later then place the new message which was earlier created and formatted with “String newMessage = tempName + “: “ + tempComment;”. This then finally uses the String.join(“\n”, pageText) method to join and format each element in the pageText array into the wanted format for the lab. In the second screenshot, the same methods were used, but this time because there are something already in the array “parameters” this increases the length of that array from 1 to 2, but either than that the same methods are used and the same else if and for loop is used to iterate though all the queries given to the website. Moving on to the values, I started with first instantiating an array of string called pageText which starts with length of zero as there are no arguments to pass through it. Then after that I instanitate another array of type string to then hold the elements of the getQuery. This will change based on each different add-message command that is put through the path. From there a tempCommant and tempName will be created to then hold the temp string values of the username as well as the comment that that user wants to input. Then in the for loop, elements of the parameters variable will be split into two different values and then places into a new array called keyValues which will contain an element 0 of key and then element 1 of value which will then be changed to be the values for tempcomment and tempname because on their key, ie if key is “s” then this will denote the comment, and if the key is “user” this will denote the user. Then a new value called newMessage will be created with the format that is needed combining the tempName and the tempComment. Another variable is then creased called pageText which will take the same elements from the pageTExtbefore it with the change that this one will have an extra slot in its array at the end to prepare room for the next element that needs to be added.
**What I learned**
These past few weeks I have leared a lot about the secure shell. I didn’t know before this that I could create a website from my computer that only I could access because I was the host, but then after using IENG6 and a public server on the UCSD internet, I could then create an SSH instance where I can create a website on the UCSD server. This then allows for me as well as others on the same wifi to access and then alter the website because my computer is no longer the host so it is no longer a private or local host.
